- day 1 Wednesday 8/13 
	- fitted for hearing aids

	- later, static sound was still there (fountain) but not as noticeable
	- drove convertible - wind sound was VERY loud.
- day 3 Friday 8/15
	- sent email regarding connection to Chromebook
	- played golf in afternoon - lots of static/hissing noise (mostly in right ear) I assume from wind.
	- still dealing with "static" sound
		- for example, wearing a hat caused that sound whenever the hat moved
- day 5 Sunday 8/17
	- getting used to "static" but it's still there
- day 6 Monday 8/18
	- played golf - windy scratching (static) sound
	- also, aids seemed to be getting loose in ear, I re-inserted them after golf and it seemed better
- day 7 Tuesday 8/9
	- I notice the hearing aids less
- day 8 Wednesday 8/9
	- played gold today. It was hot, so I sweated somewhat. Aids seem to "move" on ear causing "static" sound
	- aids move to outer part of ear (back)
