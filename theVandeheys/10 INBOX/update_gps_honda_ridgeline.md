Honda vehicles with Garmin Navigation come with either 3 (2021 Honda North America vehicles and newer) or 5 years (all other model years and regions) of map updates at no cost.  These map updates are available roughly once per calendar year.  

Starting in 2015, Garmin began providing navigation in select Honda vehicles. We do not provide navigation for all models of Honda vehicles in all countries after 2015. On our website, you may see a Honda vehicle listed that does not use Garmin navigation in your country or region.

Contact your local Honda dealership for additional information on how to update if you are unsure if your vehicle has Garmin navigation.

## NOTES BEFORE CONTINUING:
