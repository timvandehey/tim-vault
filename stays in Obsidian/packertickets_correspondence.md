If you're looking for Packer tickets from me, just head over to https://packertickets.thevandeheys.com and fill out the form. All tickets come in a set of 2.

The form only shows what's currently up for grabs. If you pick something, I'll need to double-check that it's still available. Sometimes tickets might not actually be available for a couple of reasons:
1. Someone else just snagged them, and I haven't updated the list yet.
2. They were also listed on the NFL exchange and sold there before I could take them down.

If they are still available, I'll ask you to pay me through PayPal (thevandeheys@gmail.com) or Venmo (@thevandeheys). Once I get the money, I'll shoot the tickets over to your email. You can find more info on how mobile tickets work here: https://www.packers.com/tickets/mobile-ticketing.
