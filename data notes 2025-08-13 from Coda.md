Centering Prayer Method

<br />

# Centering Prayer Method

“Choose a sacred word as the symbol of your intention to consent to God’s presence and action within.\
Sitting comfortably and with eyes closed, settle briefly and silently introduce the sacred word as the symbol of your consent to God’s presence and action within.\
When engaged with your thoughts \[including body sensations, feelings, images, and reflections], return ever so gently to the sacred word.\
At the end of the prayer period, remain in silence with eyes closed for a couple of minutes.”

https\://eastvalleyfamilyphysicians.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dr-Lawrence-Profile.jpg



## Dr. Conrad Lawrence, M.D.

Dr. Lawrence joined East Valley Family Physicians in 2019. He is dedicated to providing quality healthcare and being more involved in the local community. Dr. Lawrence is an Air Force Veteran and began his medical career as an ER shift leader and military medic in the Air Force. He went on to earn a Bachelor’s of Science in the Des Moines University’s physician assistant program in Iowa. He subsequently earned his Doctorate of Medicine in from Saba University School of Medicine in Saba, Netherlands Antilles. He then completed his residency at the University of New Mexico. Dr. Lawrence is board certified in Family Medicine. The best skill he believes he brings to the Chandler community stems from his military experience. “My journey from a military medic to a physician has taught me a lot. We all have something unique within us, and for me, I think the ability to listen well and be compassionate has really allowed me to be a better person and physician.” Outside of work, Dr. Lawrence enjoys fishing, woodworking and reading. He and his wife reside in Gilbert and are proud parents of a teenage son and two spoiled pugs.

\
**YOUR MLB.TV MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION:** With your monthly subscription, you get access to all regular season MLB games online or on your favorite supported smartphones, tablets and connected devices ([subject to blackout restrictions in the US](https://links.mlb.mlbemail.com/s/c/K7_4Nex6LIbKqPp5vU2LN3rw8cH2H-PpZdVxjkonJqIPoM0OcAl2xNE_xP17_WSAdPYUVlx5tKrhOmbxwSOvWwKX2EHxkhdiMQUmuClzAVDlk6BDiLg-HtlbPJs_YcKXJJNiWSRbwsSsB3_8vqvxZErLRcknH_rWFk283ZUN3qJ2liZ33IO56l3jxoJ5dlNwF0RhA9E4rWlO6QZyMm_IvnLS2yF7TIe9l5L1KE3xfr3So_7S_4ZaWS041Nt1Eo-_w2JHK0wTfSbLjBYUTM9O1w-yEw_YM42RjoSqXXncjI9OwZcOhPn2jcsM46mN0wJ3nxy0D2BvBATNyd93_R85fWFp-Rt449S2eZnzMnFVGpJ65rmPIqPpVjgdckdRuO6jjQJg2Uky8iQLo75UYBhipjjWSP3Tb2zp3KB5S7SrLkD7yUUoLYErWOLSDhARs8BckM3WrwBmjg3ka57pWWYT1GUXhjz4IPSgJp7p99-0JNIqQ0yCNClQq8HUwZv35BNho-QtjdfcM7e1ctuTX2BIc7uE4mMIjSUFAu2ypI_Ih5taaVGO0HE/rMvMv_3PQMLUpa9S8OdnRTj_S_qiOcSX/7)) as well as select Spring Training games (with no blackout restrictions). That means access to high-definition home and away feeds, live game DVR, and enriched in-game playback controls like clickable linescores, live scoreboards and multiview (not all features available on all devices).** Authenticated subscribers will also be able to stream each game of the 2025 Postseason as well as the 95th All-Star Game on supported devices. Your subscription also offers you full access to blackout-free audio broadcasts from all 30 teams and MLB Big Inning seven days a week, along with access to local pregame and postgame coverage for select teams.

**MLB Network on MLB.TV (Available in the US Only)**

Your MLB.TV subscription now includes 24/7 access to live MLB Network programming through the MLB apps. MLB.TV subscribers will be able to stream live out-of-market MLB Network Showcase Games as well as MLB Network shows like *MLB Tonight, MLB Central, Intentional Talk* and *MLB Now*.

**Stream Games in 1080p**

Starting this season, MLB.TV will stream regular season games in 1080p. That means enhanced video quality, sharper images and a more immersive viewing experience.

**More than MLB Games**

Stream live MiLB affiliate’s games, MLB Big Inning and local Pre/Postgame shows in the MLB app. Enjoy original series like *Carded* and *Over The Plate*, as well as documentaries and additional live programming all season long.

\
**FREE TRIAL POLICY:** You may cancel a trial any time during the 7-day window and will still have access to MLB.TV for the full 7 days. **If you do not cancel, you will be billed on the 8th day for the full 2025 subscription price.** MLB reserves the right to determine customer eligibility for trial memberships in its sole discretion.

Reset The Regulator When In Bypass

<br />

# Reset The Regulator When In Bypass

How To Reset The Regulator When In Bypass

If you think your grill is in bypass mode, you can reset the regulator by following these steps:

Turn off all the burners and close the tank valve.\
Wait 60 seconds.\
Open the tank valve fully and wait a few seconds for pressure in the regulator and gas hose to equalize.\
Open the grill lid, then open one of the burner control knobs and light the grill.\
Turn all burners to HIGH and close the lid.\
The flames should be strong and the grill should heat to over 500°F in 10-15 minutes.

If this process does not work, try it again, but in Step 2 disconnect the regulator from the propane tank and wait 60 seconds before reconnecting it and proceeding to Step 3.

Trinity Prayer by Richard Rohr

God for us, we call You Father,\
God alongside us, we call You Jesus,\
God within us, we call You Holy Spirit.

You are the Eternal Mystery\
that enables, enfolds, and enlivens all things,\
even us, and even me.

Every name falls short of your\
Goodness and Greatness.

We can only see who You are in what is.

We ask for such perfect seeing.\
As it was in the beginning, is now,\
and ever shall be.

Amen

### If Wyze Color Bulbs go offline

You need to re-add the device. To put the bulb in a “new” state (reset), turn the power off three times (sort of quickly). \[For the Condo front outside lights, the far right switch]. The bulb will pulse (green?). In the app, add that device with the same name as before. It should be OK now. Check the automation(s) and groups to ensure they are still correct and working.

## Sync sensors with Valve

1. To configure your Water Leak Sensor 1 as a controller, Press and hold the SET button for 5-10 seconds until the LED quickly blinks green, then, release the button.
2. To configure a Valve Controller as the responder, close the valve using SET button or via YoLink app (verify the valve is shown to be Closed on the app).Press and hold the SET button for 5-10 seconds until the LED quickly blinks green, then, release the button.

Setting Water Valve Controller

1. Upon pairing, the LED will stop blinking (this may happen after only blinking two or three times).

When the Water Leak Sensor detects water, the Valve Controller will now immediately close the valve. The valve will remain closed until opened via the app or using the SET button; the restoral of the Water Leak Sensor to normal (no water detected) does not open the valve.

More advanced sequences, controlling multiple outputs (e.g.close valve and activate siren) are available via the YoLink app. To take a look at the smart valve solutions we offer, please visit our Smart Water Solutions page.
