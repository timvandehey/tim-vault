# YOLINK

1. To configure your Water Leak Sensor 1 as a controller, Press and hold the SET button for 5-10 seconds until the LED quickly blinks green, then, release the button.

2. To configure a Valve Controller as the responder, close the valve using SET button or via YoLink app (verify the valve is shown to be Closed on the app).Press and hold the SET button for 5-10 seconds until the LED quickly blinks green, then, release the button.

Setting Water Valve Controller

3. Upon pairing, the LED will stop blinking (this may happen after only blinking two or three times).

When the Water Leak Sensor detects water, the Valve Controller will now immediately close the valve. The valve will remain closed until opened via the app or using the SET button; the restoral of the Water Leak Sensor to normal (no water detected) does not open the valve.

More advanced sequences, controlling multiple outputs (e.g.close valve and activate siren) are available via the YoLink app. To take a look at the smart valve solutions we offer, please visit our Smart Water Solutions page.
